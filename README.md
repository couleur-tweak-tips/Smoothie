# ðŸ§‹ Smoothie [WIP]

Smoothie is a fork of [blur](https://github.com/f0e/blur) rewritten in Python with the following enhancements:
* Wrote in dead simple Python, code (cli & vpy script) is roughly 150 lines long. The only feature we can't bother to port is the [preview](https://github.com/f0e/blur/blob/master/blur/preview.cpp), which is made in C++
* Static blur config, you won't have to recreate/carry your config around each time you change directory
* Queue multiple files at once via Send To
